It uses instance variables to store account details and methods to manipulate these details.

2. User Interaction:

The program interacts with the user via the console to perform various operations like deposit, withdrawal, and checking balance.

3. Control Structures:

The program uses control structures such as loops (do-while) and conditionals (if-else, switch-case) to handle user input and perform actions based on it.

4. Data Validation:

The program includes basic input validation to ensure that deposits and withdrawals are only processed if the amounts are positive.

5. Encapsulation:

The BankAccount class keeps its variables private and provides public methods to access and modify them, demonstrating encapsulation.
